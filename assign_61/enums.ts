//Making Enums for Vehicles: Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles using enums, and show one example.

// enums are both a type and value at a sametime however objects need separate key and value

enum vehicles {
    cars,
    trucks,
    motorcycles
}

console.log(vehicles.trucks)
